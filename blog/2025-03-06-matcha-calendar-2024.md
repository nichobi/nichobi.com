2024 was my fifth year running of tea advent calendars, for most of which I've been trying to sample as large a variety as possible.
This year, rather try a little bit of everything, I decided to narrow the scope and try a large selection in a small niche.

I was a little nervous going in.
While I really like matcha, I haven't drunk *that* much of it before.
I started drinking it seriously a couple of years ago when working on my thesis, but being near-broke I went for the cheapest matcha I could get my hands on.
The first few times I seemingly lucked out, getting pretty fresh, green matcha powder with a reasonably balanced flavour.
Over time my luck started running out, and I ended up finding more and more lifeless, oxidised matcha, that was way too bitter to drink.
I did my best to use it up through baking, but quickly ended up with more than I could use up.
As I couldn't bring myself to buy more when I had so much, albeit undrinkable, matcha drinking was largely put on hold.

Since then, I've had the occasional tipple, but felt a strong urge to get back into it properly.
When I found [Nio tea's matcha advent calendar](https://nioteas.com/products/matcha-advent-calendar), it seemed like a perfect opportunity to build up a new routine while learning more about matcha and my tastes.

Drinking 24 matchas in 24 days was a pretty intense experience, and quite tricky to do while working full-time in the run-up to Christmas.
On one hand I wanted to give each matcha all the attention it deserved, trying each matcha in a controlled setting and really taking the time to figure out my thoughts on it.
On the other, I had to make it work in whatever way I could fit it into my life.
This ended up requiring me to make matcha in four different cities each with its own water quality and different equipment; and my comments on each tea were strongly affected by how much time I had to think and write.
All this is to say that this is in no way an objective, laboratory controlled analysis.
There's a healthy dose of randomness involved, but I can say with certainty that there was a huge amount of wonderful matcha in here.
Some of the matchas were strikingly different from each other, yet absolutely delicious in their own ways.
The experience has greatly expanded my understanding of what matcha can be, and I'm thrilled to drink more.

## Day 1: Kyoto Matcha Masudaen

</details>

My first time making matcha in almost a year (I drank a ton when working on my thesis), so I'm a little out of practice. This will have to act as something of a baseline, but so far so good.

A wonderful green colour, with a sweet, fruity (stone fruit?) fragrance.  
Dark, rich flavour. Quite bitter, but not astringent.


## Day 2: Uji Matcha Chanoka Okumidori

![A bowl of pastel green matcha powder](images/advent-2024/2/3.jpg){loading="lazy"}
</details>

A significantly darker tea this time around, with a more mellow, rounded flavour. I generally lean more towards the fresher aromas, but this was also really nice, with a good sweetness and full body.


## Day 3: Saemidori Matcha Henta

</details>

About equally dark as the last one but this one was a lot more bitter, a bit too much for my taste. It did have some fresh grassy and fruity notes in the aroma, but the bitterness overwhelmed them when tasting. The note's promise of sweetness was not fulfilled :/

(Seems my camera didn't take well to the lighting, so everything is extra green today)


## Day 4: Premium Matcha Latte Powder

</details>

The first latte-quality matcha of the batch, so obediently I threw together my first ever matcha latte. I opted to not add any sugar and I'm glad for it. The frothed (oat)milk really brings out the sweetness of the matcha while muting the bitterness, no sweetener needed. It's different from regular matcha but still good.

(No latte art, I'm afraid :') Maybe I'll learn along the way if there are many more latte matchas in here)


## Day 5: Asamiya Yabukita Matcha

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>

</details>

This one really has a lot of bright, fruity notes in the aroma, and they really carry over into the flavour, merging beautifully with the sweet richness. The bitterness is there and gives some nice body but almost completely fades into the background. I really loved this, definitely the current favourite :)


## Day 6: Japanese Matcha Tea Osada Okumidori

</details>

A very smooth and balanced matcha, almost feels like the platonic ideal of matcha. Quite a deep, earthy flavour along with some nice sweetness but nothing that jumps to the forefront, for better or worse.


## Day 7: Wazuka Matcha Seisui

</details>

This one is a bit more bitterness-forward, but equally satisfying with its deep umami and grassy flavour, but still with a bit of those fresher flavours creeping in underneath. One for when in the mood for something a bit more full-bodied :)


## Day 8: Latte Matcha Basic Grade

</details>

Compared to the premium latte from day 4, this one was significantly less sweet and the bitterness comes through quite a bit more. Still a pretty enjoyable drink, but I do think this one actually could've benefited from a little bit of added sugar.


## Day 9: Asamiya Saemidori Matcha

</details>

Wow, what an aroma! Incredibly fruity, sweet and tart (leaning towards raspberry). Flavour wise, it's super smooth, with just enough bitterness and a really rich flavour. Those fruity notes are there, but with how strong they were in the fragrance, I'd hoped they'd also be more at the forefront here. Either way, this was phenomenal!


## Day 10: Nishi Okumidori Matcha

</details>

Beautifully intense, deep green colour on this one (more so than the camera captured). A very rich, somewhat earthy flavour, but with a slight chalkiness to it that lets it down.


## Day 11: Shizuoka Matcha Kakitsubata

</details>

Nicely balanced bitterness and sweetness. The aroma is a bit more on the sweet and fruity side, while the flavour is more on the rich side, but they complement and fit with each other very well.

</details>

Incredibly sweet, fruity tea, with plenty of umami and some vegetal notes but absolutely nonexistent bitterness. It's not quite as nuanced as some of the others here, but a very easy (probably the easiest I've ever tried) matcha to enjoy :)


## Day 13: Masudaen Makinohara Green Tea Sample

Extraordinarily beautiful, deep, vibrant green colour. High on umami, deep rounded character with even sweetness and bitterness.


## Day 14: Kagoshima Tea Hime Sakamoto

Pretty understated but very smooth.

(I've really fallen behind on posting, but I do have pictures and (slightly briefer) notes written down for each of them. Will try to catch up)

A really deep, rich profile on this one with pretty strong grassy notes. Extra bonus points for the cute mascot :)

This was a wonderful, darker matcha with a nice deep flavour, and as the note says quite nutty.


## Day 17: Premium Matcha Chiran Green Tea

</details>

Citrusy fragrance, but not a super standout flavour. I was a bit rushed on this one and didn't sift it, which probably didn't help it as it was pretty lumpy out of the satchel.


## Day 18: Asamiya Sayamamidori Matcha

This one has a lot of different flavours going on at once, with the bitter, sweet and fruity all coexisting. None of them overshadowing or neutralising each other, each one enjoyable.

A lovely deep flavour, with something of a toasty (or roasted) profile to it that I've not encountered before in matcha but really worked along with the other notes.

This one seemed to turn out quite thin and I really struggled to whisk it up. Not sure if I just didn't manage to get enough out of the satchel (I could make a whole series of posts about my thoughts on packaging), used too much water, or if it was down to the tea. Unfortunately, this was also the day I forgot to take a pic of the powder, so there's less to go on.

This was a very deep, rich matcha, with some hints of fruitiness in the aroma but it hits you with quite a bitter first impression, followed by a smooth, sweet finish.
