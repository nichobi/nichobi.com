For a few years now I've been buying tea calendars each advent.
At first, it was mostly the novelty of having a new (often flavoured) tea to drink each day, but as my interest in tea has developed, it has become more about expanding my horizons and trying out different kinds of tea.

In 2023, I got the pure tea advent calendar from [Tee Kontor Kiel](https://www.tee-kontor-kiel.de), and kept a [daily log](https://social.spejset.org/@nichobi/111504166462017425) on Mastodon for each tea.
This was partially to share and discuss thoughts about the teas, but mostly served as a notebook for myself to remember what teas I'd tried, how I'd brewed them and what my thoughts on them were.
Writing things down also served to force myself to consider the teas a bit more deeply.

<hr>

However, over the past month as I revisit and finish each tea, I've wished for an easier to find, permanent place for the calendar.
I've therefore collated each of the 24 posts into this single blog post.
Perhaps I'll do the same with next year's, or even the second tea calendar I picked up cheap from my favourite tea spot in January...


## Day 1: Pai Mu Tan

</details>

<div>
White tea, China\
5g, 75°, ~30 sec
</div>

Of all the 24 teas, this is the only one to come in an extra large packet, likely due to its big unshaped leaves. I've had a few pai mu tans (or baimudan) before and I'm always happy to drink them. I mostly hear people talk about white tea's smooth flavour, but it's that almost spicy note to it that I truly adore.


## Day 2: Sencha Miyazaki

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>

</details>

<div>
Green tea, Japan\
5g, ~60°, ~60 seconds
</div>

I absolutely love sencha, but this one was a bit underwhelming. Aroma was very grassy and had the expected umami richness, but there wasn't much depth, and hardly any sweetness or fruitiness. Still, even a poor sencha makes a pretty good tea, so I shan't complain.


## Day 3: Darjeeling Ambootia FTGFOP

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>

</details>

<div>
Black tea, India\
5g, 90°, 4 minutes
</div>

Was surprised by the lighter oxidation, and my first impressions of the aroma were quite fresh, though the flavour had all the strong character of a black tea. I don't drink much Indian tea, so was a little out of my comfort zone here. Opted for a western style brew, but I'm not sure I got it quite right. Intrigued to maybe try it gong fu next.


## Day 4: Hōjicha Miyazaki

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>

Preparation temp. asian. 3-5g/200m 80-90°C 60-75 sec. Follow-up infusion 10-20 sec until the flavour fades" loading="lazy"></div>
</details>

<div>
Toasted green tea, Japan\
5g, 85°, 60 seconds
</div>

This hōjicha is toasted to quite a significantly lower degree than I'm used to. Putting the leaves into the preheated gaiwan I felt notes sweet and rich notes, reminiscent of raspberry, coconut, chocolate. The brew was more on the toasty side, but with a surprising amount of that green tea character intact. Those toasty flavours always hit just right during the colder months!


## Day 5: Formosa Oolong Jade Pearls

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>

</details>

<div>
Oolong, Taiwan\
5g, 95°, 30 sec
</div>

The aroma was very sweet & floral, which while still there in the brew was joined by some richer flavors. It was quite milky but with a definite seaweediness to the first few brews that took me by surprise. An enjoyable tea!


## Day 6: Formosa Dark Pearl Oolong

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>
<img src="images/advent-2023/6/1.jpg" alt="Photo of a tea tray, with a gaiwan mostly full of dark wet leaves and a pitcher of rich amber liquid." loading="lazy">

Brilliant, amber-coloured cup with a ripe, fruity bouquet." loading="lazy"></div>
</details>

<div>
Oolong, Taiwan\
5g, 95°, 20 sec
</div>

A fun pairing with yesterday's, two Taiwanese Oolongs on opposite ends of the oxidation scale. Of course, first of all you notice how much richer and darker this tea is in both appearance and flavour, and think them nothing alike. However, the same sweetness can still be found here and those floral notes have merely shifted towards syrupy fruit. One of my favourites so far!


## Day 7: Nepal Summer Flush Premium

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>

</details>

<div>
Black tea, Nepal\
3.3g, 100°, 45 seconds
</div>

This is a black tea (and my first from Nepal!) but funnily enough I think the leaves smell much more like a white tea. Maybe it has that spicyness I mentioned on day 1? I think it was still there in the brew, but hard to tell through the strong black tea character. I'm intrigued to brew it with cooler water next time to see if it comes through more.


## Day 8: Sencha Kirishima Yabukita

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>
<img src="images/advent-2023/8/1.jpg" alt="Photo of a tea tray with a small kyusu with rich dark green tea leaves and a cup of pale but vibrant green liquid" loading="lazy">

</details>

<div>
Green tea, Japan\
5g, 65°, 1 min
</div>

I already had a few brews worth of this in my tea shelf from my last order, which I'm gonna use up first, hence the more broken up pieces and unfortunately slightly less wow factor. This to me is a great sencha, with that rich umami balanced by sweetness and lovely nectarine aroma, but some of that freshness has definitely been lost over time. Looking forward to opening the fresh package in the near future.


## Day 9: Ceylon Gentle Wake Up

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>

</details>

<div>
Black tea, Sri Lanka\
5g, ~100°, 2½ minutes
</div>

Went for a western style brew on this, but it's not quite my cup of tea. I don't drink a lot of black tea, so I'm far from an expert, but this didn't seem all that special to me. Tastes like your usual black tea.


## Day 10: Sencha Hisui

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>
<img src="images/advent-2023/10/1.jpg" alt="Photo of a tea tray with a cup of bright green tea with a few miniscule bits of leaf at the bottom and a small unglazed kyūsu filled with richly green wet tea leaves" loading="lazy">

The aftertaste is delicately creamy." loading="lazy"></div>
</details>

<div>
Green tea, Japan\
4g, 65°, 1 min
</div>

My first impressions of the leaves were of sweet fruit, warmness and just a hint of toastiness. Applying heat took it to rich and gave it an indefinable vegetal quality, a transformation which continued when brewed into something somehow reminiscent of roasted caramelised vegetables. I very much look forward to brewing more of this!


## Day 11: White Cui Min Qingshan

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>
<img src="images/advent-2023/11/1.jpg" alt="Photo of a tea tray with a cup and fairness pitcher containing a slightly cloudy pale golden brew, and a gaiwan of wet leaves" loading="lazy">

</details>

<div>
White tea, China\
5g, 80°, 30 sec
</div>

Putting these in a heated gaiwan produced some bizarre aromas I've ever experienced. It was sweet, rich and distinctly tomatoey. In essence: ketchup. Brewed it was bright and slightly cloudy, and tasted much more like expected of a white tea, with a nice round character and only a hint of that previous aroma. Not that outstanding however, and I'm mainly curious to see if I experience the same notes next time.


## Day 12: Tai Mu Long Zhu

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>
<img src="images/advent-2023/12/1.jpg" alt="Photo of a tea tray with a cup and fairness pitcher of pale, almost entirely transparent liquid, and a gaiwan of pale green leaves" loading="lazy">

</details>

<div>
Green tea, China\
3.3g, 75°, 60 sec
</div>

These "dragon pearls" were quite slow to open up, giving a light flavour on the first brew. What was there however was sweet, bright, and hit most of the right; and it all came through stronger on the second brew. Still, it wasn't packing quite as much flavour as I'd've hoped.


## Day 13: Kukicha Miyazaki Morimoto

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>
<img src="images/advent-2023/13/1.jpg" alt="Photo of a tea tray with a small kyusu with rich dark green tea leaves mixed with lighter stems and a cup of pale green liquid" loading="lazy">

</details>

<div>
Green tea, Japan\
5g, 70°, 60 sec
</div>

I haven't had quality kukicha before, only knowing it as a residual product sorted out from sencha. Upon seeing and smelling it, I realised it probably had a lot more to offer than I had expected, and my plans to brew it in a gaiwan went out the window.

Similar to sencha in many ways, but there's something distinct to it I can't quite put my finger on. I'll have to investigate further.


## Day 14: Fujian Black & Gold Tips

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>
<img src="images/advent-2023/14/1.jpg" alt="Photo of tea tray with a cup and fairness pitcher with dark reddish liquid and a gaiwan with wet brown tea buds in it" loading="lazy">

Only the young, fluffy leaf buds are harvested for this tea, which have a golden shimmer and a slightly rnalty, chocolaty and sweet flavour with a long aftertaste." loading="lazy"></div>
</details>

<div>
Black tea, China\
3.3g, 95°, 15 sec
</div>

Again a black tea that reminds me of white tea, which suggests I don't know what I'm talking about. It seems what I'm actually smelling are the fluffy buds in both teas, which I first encountered in white teas.

This tea is absolutely delicious. Sweet, honeylike flavour alongside some wonderful dark notes. I can't adequately describe it, but I can't wait to brew it again.


## Day 15: Wen-Shan Pouchong

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>
<img src="images/advent-2023/15/1.jpg" alt="Photo of a tea tray with a gaiwan of dark, vividly green tea leaves and a cup of light green liquid" loading="lazy">

</details>

<div>
Green tea/oolong, Taiwan\
5g, 90°, 30 sec
</div>

Dry: milky oolong
Wet: sweet, rich, raspberry?
Aroma: milky oolong

I've never seen a tea described as both green and oolong before but I'd say the flavour leans closer to (lightly oxidized) oolong. A delicious creamy and floral brew, sweet and a bit nutty, perhaps picking up some raspberry notes. Very nice!


## Day 16: Fuding Wuyi Jin Jun Mei

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>
<img src="images/advent-2023/16/1.jpg" alt="Photo of a tea tray with a gaiwan of dark brown wet tea leaves, and a cup of dark copper liquid" loading="lazy">

The larger package has the text: Fuding Wagy Jin Jun Mei An outstanding black tea with a highly aromatic, flavoursome character and a brilliant, shimmering golden cup. Delicately spicy and tangy on the palate, with a hint of citrus and forest honey. Over the course of the infusion, mineral and pleasantly bready notes are added. The tea is remarkably persistent and its dry leaf is delicate, dark and covered with honey-golden tips." loading="lazy"></div>
</details>

<div>
Black tea, China\
5g, 95°, 15 sec
</div>

This tea was immediately reminiscent of day 14's, but with a significantly darker profile. This emphasises earthy, chocolaty notes over the sweetness. The slight spiciness is still there and it has a luscious mouthfeel. I'd've been amazed at this tea three days ago (and it is great) but 14 was slightly more to my taste.

This only came with half the regular amount, so I'm afraid I won't be able to revisit it.


## Day 17: Snow Dragon Xue Long Dongzhai

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>
<img src="images/advent-2023/17/1.jpg" alt="Photo of a tea tray with a cup of pale only barely greenish liquid and a gaiwan of muted green tea leaves and buds" loading="lazy">

This fine premium green tea was harvested in spring, when there are still a few last frosty days every now and then. With its greenish-white leaf and delicate flavour, this tea is somewhat reminiscent of white tea. Snow Dragon tastes fresh and light when brewed for a short time and delicately aromatic when brewed for longer." loading="lazy"></div>
</details>

<div>
Green tea, China\
3.3g, 80°, 45 sec

This green tea really seems to skirt the line to white tea. It manages to capture aspects from both, giving a sweet, floral brew with a very satisfying savouriness.


## Day 18: Formosa Honey Black

</details>

<div>

My first impressions of this tea were quite tepid, it seemed a fairly usual black tea, but the aftertaste is quite intriguing. It reminds me of toasted seeds and I rather like it.


## Day 19: Oolong Ruby Thailand

</details>

<div>
Oolong, Thailand\
5g, 95°, 60 sec
</div>

A darker oolong again, and my first ever tea from Thailand. It's sweet and aromatic, and backed up well by a full body. Very nice and strikes me as quite similar to day 6, but we'll have to see how they compare side by side at some point in the future.


## Day 20: Darjeeling Seeyok

<details><summary>Show/hide photos</summary>

</details>

<div>
Black tea, India\
5g, 2.5 minutes

A nice enough black tea, with a fairly fruity aroma and balanced sweet and bitter flavour. Not all that interesting however, so I'm having it at my desk while working on my thesis.


## Day 21: Kabusecha Shiho

This is fantastic. Has all my favourite qualities in a Japanese green, with a great balance of umami and sweetness. Kabusecha is a new term for me, but from what I've (briefly) researched, it's essentially sencha that's been shaded before harvest, but not for as long as gyokuro. I've had a couple of shaded senchas before though, which perhaps would qualify as kabusecha. I love it.


## Day 22: Ceylon Mellow Black

Another dark, sweet tea today, but with a bit more of a floral, fruity character. A very smooth and satisfying brew.

With further infusions, fruity, subtly tart notes stand out, but the sweetness remains." loading="lazy"></div>

What a way to stick the landing. I suspected they might go for a gyokuro to round things off, and I was very pleased to find my theory correct. Umami, sweetness and bitterness in a wonderful balance. A deeply satisfying, cloudy and vibrant brew.

Apologies for the poor lighting, I had to do a pre-dawn brew to make time for it on a busy day of celebrations. Merry Christmas!
