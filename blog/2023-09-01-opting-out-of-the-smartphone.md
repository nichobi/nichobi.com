I recently blogged about my experience of social media in [Social Media, Mastodon and Me](/2023-08-13-social-media-mastodon-and-me).
My initial outline of that post was quite a bit wider, also discussing my thoughts on today's digital landscape and our increasingly smartphone-dependent society, but I decided to rein it in and focus on a single topic.
This post is somewhat of a sequel, expanding on those thoughts and chronicling the first steps of me giving up my smartphone (for the second time).

## Background

Lately I've been longing back to the year in mid-2017 to mid-2018 during which I gave up my smartphone for a dumbphone.
It seemed a wild experiment at the time, and came with its fair share of challenges, but was also one of the most rewarding times of my life.
I picked up playing an instrument, I found myself to be a lot more present in the moment than I was previously or am today.

It all came to and end when a friend and I headed out on a ten-week road trip across the USA.
Spending an average of 4 hours a day in a car, having a phone for entertainment and utility (navigation, finding accommodation) was hard to give up.
Either way, my dumbphone turned out not to support the American wavebands, so I had little choice.
Once I got back, I'd once again grown accustomed to the smartphone life, and never made the switch again.

This follows the usual pattern of these feelings ebbing and flowing over the years.
My frustration builds up slowly over a number of months, eventually leading me to dial back on my smartphone use, only to over time fall back into the habit for the sake of convenience.

## The Easy Solution<sup>[*](#*)</sup>

A common first step for me has been to degoogle my phone, switching to a fully open source ROM without any Google Apps or services built in (or in some cases [microG](https://microg.org/) as a limited, open-source substitute).
I think I've gone through this procedure half a dozen times in my life, teaching me a few lessons:

1. Clearly I have a strong desire to get my data away from Google.
2. It's hard.
3. It doesn't stick.

After all these attempts, sooner or later I've slid back into the regular swing of things.
The feasibility of opting out of the smartphone gets slimmer and slimmer by the year.
Since my dumbphone year in 2017, basic things like taking the local bus have gotten significantly harder ([bus cards discontinued in 2019](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/skane/jojo-korten-forsvinner), [timetables removed from bus stops in 2021](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/skanetrafiken/pressreleases/13-december-ny-tidtabell-paa-skaanetrafiken-3057811#:~:text=Nytt%20f%C3%B6r%20i%20%C3%A5r%20%C3%A4r,p%C3%A5%20v%C3%A5ra%20bussh%C3%A5llplatser)).

Another thing that's been hindering me from getting a dumbphone again is the reliance it would create on SMS and phone calls for communication.
I strongly believe in secure, private communication as a basic human right and while my aversion to handing my communication history to a tech giant like Facebook or Google is unparalleled, handing it to my cell phone provider (and anyone they share it with) isn't particularly appealing either.


## The Ideal Solution<sup>[**](#**)</sup>

In an ideal world, I would have a simple [feature phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_phone) that supported a secure chat protocol.
Turns out I'm not alone in this wish, and there actually are a few projects in that vein.
KaiOS is a modern feature phone operating system, with support for custom web apps.
The development community seems to consist of a few dedicated developers, single-handedly creating applications, the most interesting of which is [chooj](https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj), a pretty impressive looking Matrix client providing fully encrypted chat and voice calls.

My interest is piqued, but the future of KaiOS seems to be very much up in the air.
The company seems to have more or less gone silent since its 3.0 release two years ago, which is still only available in the US on phones that can't be unlocked or sideload apps.
Without sideloading, the only way to install apps is via the KaiStore, which currently [demands](https://developer.kaiostech.com/docs/distribution/submission-guideline/) including adverts in the app.

All in all, it's something to keep an eye on, but I'm hesitant to buy a new phone without being certain of it having a long lifespan.

When I started writing this blog post, I still held out some hope of making this work by limiting the potential of the smartphone.
After a few more weeks of the experiment it became apparent that it wasn't working out.
I became convinced that the only way to go was to give up the smartphone again, and after a few encouraging chats with similarly inclined friends I finally found the bravery to do it.

This morning I dug out the SIM card and stuck it in my 2017 Nokia 105 (it seems it still has about 2 years of use to it before they repurpose the 2G wavebands).
In addition to the phone, I'll be carrying my digital audio player, an xDuoo X3 I also picked up in 2017 running [Rockbox](https://rockbox.org/).
For longer journeys, I'll also be bringing my e-reader, a Kobo Clara HD, which I foresee seeing increased use throughout the day.

These single purpose devices give a much more confined experience, doing one job but doing it extremely well.
When I was picking away at my smartphone's software bit by bit, hoping to tear it down to the bare essentials, I always had to keep myself from compromising and reinstalling apps when things get inconvenient.
These devices come with their own innate limits, and opting out of them is practically impossible.
Some of these limits are good, some I will have to learn to live with.

Since I'm writing this right at the moment of making the change, I don't yet know how well it's going to work out (doubtless with some trouble along the way).
Stay tuned and I'll report back in a few weeks with a new blog post.
