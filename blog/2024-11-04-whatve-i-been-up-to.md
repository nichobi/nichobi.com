One of my goals since the very start of this blog has been to make that classic post, seen on nearly all personal blogs, where the author apologises for the recent lack of posts and promises to do better in future.
It seems that time has finally arrived, as more time has passed between my latest blog post and now, than between the blog's creation and that previous post.
Apologies for the radio silence, and I do hope to get back in the swing of things again.

The main reason for the silence has been due to a rather large changes in my life.
My last post was written shortly after I graduated from my master's degree in computer science/engineering and rushed out just two days before I started my first real job, perhaps because I anticipated I'd find less time for writing thereafter.
Since March, I've been working as a consultant for a tech company in Copenhagen.
This has had a pretty major effect on my daily life, in ways both good and bad.
Perhaps chief of all is how my free time has been drastically reduced, not only because of an 8-hour workday but also because of the sheer amount of commuting.

See, I *love* my home town of Lund and have absolutely no intention of moving anytime soon.
On the other hand, I'm really enjoying working in Copenhagen.
This means commuting about 90 minutes each way, from Sweden to Denmark and back again, 4--5 days a week.

3 hours is a long time to spend travelling on a daily basis, but I find it a lot less of a pain than people tend to assume.
Crucially, I don't see this time as lost.
I've previously written several blog posts on the subject of getting rid of my smartphone, and my commute might be where it's had the largest payoff.
Each journey consists of approximately 15 minutes of biking, 40 minutes on the train, 15 minutes on the metro (with some overhead in-between each leg).
I spend the morning train trip working, but each minute of train home and metro each way is spent reading books or listening to music.
By not giving myself the option of lazily browsing social media, this time has become some of my most valued time in the day, free from distractions and with nothing else to do than focus on things I find important.

<figcaption>The Øresund Bridge, which I commute across every day</figcaption>
</figure>

The view is astounding.
Having a commute over the bridge is in many ways a blessing, and chief among them is the beautiful view.
I've had time enough to experience it in three seasons, and every trip is a little different from the last.
Perhaps most spectacular is when the sun is just rising over Malmö as the train reaches the bridge, and a streak of the sea ignites with reflected sunlight.
Just the other day, both sea and land were covered in a quick layer of fog, under a cloudy sky.
Sandwiched between fog and clouds was a thin sliver of clear air, pierced only by Malmö's tallest buildings, behind which was the warm yellow of the rising sun.

Another huge relief has been the possibility to entirely disconnect from work when I clock out for the day.
My rather lax and flexible study routine had its perks, but resulted in me always feeling like I was behind of where I should be and on the verge of failure (often this was true).
This came with a near constant base layer of anxiety and guilt, eating into any attempt to relax or do something fun.
(I won't even get into the economic worries).
Even though it was often for good reason, being stressed like that rarely improved my productivity and took its toll on my wellbeing.

Since starting work, I've taken to a full division of work and private life.
I've had to take a work phone (a smart one, even), but take great pains to avoid putting anything fun on it, keeping it as a mere tool of the trade.
The positive of this is I can then turn the phone off as soon as I finish work, and completely disconnect until the next workday.
My work phone even lets me schedule it to turn off automatically, at the precise time I take the train home.
Having spoken to friends and family, it seems I'm quite fortunate to have a position where I'm able to completely disconnect like that, without expectations of reachability, so I'm grateful for it.

All in all, my free time has plummeted in comparison to before but while I've less of it, and I'm sometimes more tired than previously, the time I do have is a lot more relaxed, and as such I'm able to find more joy in the little things.
Overall, I'm quite happy with the change.

Thanks for reading!
This post was a little less fenced than most of my previous ones, and as such has morphed hugely since I started it in summer (I don't think a single sentence made it through from that version).
I do have a lot more to say in adjacent topics, so there might be more of this coming, although this blog continues to be topic-less.
