I've been spending a lot of time on Mastodon lately, and as much fun as I'm having, I've also been struggling to unify my enthusiasm for open, federated software with my more or less lifelong dislike of social media.
Truth is, I don't think I've ever been as active on any social site as I am on Mastodon (which is still only a couple posts a week), but I'm coming to realise I'm more in enthused by the principles of it, rather than the product itself.

I've had a love for open source software for the better part of my online life, and I truly believe in the power of federation to empower the users of social platforms.
I really want it to succeed!
On the other hand, using it reminds me of all my previous experiences on social media and why they all came to an end.

I've been trying to trim my Mastodon timeline down for as long as I've been using it, but it still takes the better part of an hour to read a day's worth of posts.
There's just too many people I want to follow, who collectively end up posting more than I can (or more aptly, *should*) read.
The amount of posts also means I pay less attention to each one, and interact with fewer and fewer.
It's starting to remind more of the platform I joined Mastodon to escape.

For most of the decade+ I had my twitter account, I habitually (or obsessively) scrolled through my feed, making sure to catch up on every single post since last time.
However, I rarely ended up actually interacting with people, even less so "normal" people.
The vast majority of my tweets were replies to accounts that rarely even acknowledged my existence.
I'd fallen into a pit of parasocial relationships and lurking (the lifeblood of social media), and despite more screen hours than I dare estimate that platform had netted me not one new friendship.

I've been on a social networks for the majority of my life at this point, perhaps the first being Bilddagboken (an early Swedish network that translates to "picture diary") when I was but a young teenager, and then facebook, twitter, reddit, google+, instagram, and so on and so on.
On all of these, I've somehow felt inadequate, posting too seldom or having too little to say.
I've read hundreds, if not thousands, of posts for every one I've made and rarely felt like I've left a mark.
On each and every one of these, the illusion has eventually faded, and I've found myself looking back on my time there disfavourably, leading to me purging my accounts.

Mastodon so far has been different, to an extent.
The lack of algorithm has shifted the focus from internet celebrities to regular folk, most of whom are happy to find new people to connect with.
I've posted more, had more conversations and got a much wider response than I ever have on any other platform.
Still, I can't say it has lead to many longer conversations, nor many deeper, lasting connections with people.

For now I'm mostly enjoying my time on Mastodon, but part of me wonders how I'll look back on it in a few years.
Perhaps things are different this time, perhaps things are still too much the same.
