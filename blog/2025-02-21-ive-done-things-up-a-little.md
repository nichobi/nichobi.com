After almost 5 years of the ASCII art, terminal-like design of nichobi.com, I decided to redesign the site from scratch.
My main goals have been:

- Cosy up the place with some nice pleasant colours, hopefully more in line with what I'm writing about.
- Make reading long form content a bit more pleasant.
- Have a less restrictive theme, so I can add some more fun elements.

The first goal lead to me switching the site to a light theme, but after some complaints from my guinea pigs (dear friends) I ended up adding a basic dark mode back in.
Even though I'm usually a dark mode user myself, I much prefer the light theme here, but I guess I can't rely on everyone having my poor sense of style :)

In an effort to improve both readability and cosiness, I switched from a monospace font to regular system fonts.
For now, I'm simply using the [Classical Humanist](https://modernfontstacks.com/#classical-humanist) set from Modern Font Stacks, which will choose a suitable font from those installed on your system.
I'm still not sure how reliable that is, so perhaps I'll ship a first-choice font in the future, but I'm struggling to figure out what that'd be.

I still have some bits and pieces left to work on (in particular I intend to rework the homepage), but hopefully things look a little nicer now. If you do have any thoughts or run into issues, please let me know!

The first iteration of nichobi.com launched back in 2021, with a heavily ascii art-influenced terminal-like design.
This wasn't my first website (the earliest one to make it onto the internet archive is from 2007).

Despite its low-tech appearance, the source of that design actually became quite complex.
While I wanted the website to look primitive, I still wanted well-structured and accessible HTML, as well as decent scaling for mobile, all without an ounce of JavaScript.
This meant I ended up writing nice semantic HTML code, then had to tweak the default CSS to make it look 'worse' so it'd adhere to my theme.

The main problem however was that my website ended up feeling too restrictive.
It wasn't fun like my earliest websites, most of which had silly gifs and music (one of these I've kept an archive of at [bestpals.isacsson.se](https://bestpals.isacsson.se)).

Nor was it a cosy site to read on.
Back when I made the initial design, my website was a single page list of my current projects, most of which were terminal applications.
When I [added a blog](https://blog.nichobi.com/2023-07-27-i-created-a-blog) to it in 2023, my page started having long form text to read, and the monospace font just wasn't comfortable.
