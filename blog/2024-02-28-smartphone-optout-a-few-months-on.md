It's now been several months since I posted about [giving up my smartphone for a dumbphone](2023-09-01-opting-out-of-the-smartphone).
You may remember I promised an update "in a few weeks" but, while I did start it shortly thereafter, I ended up having to put it on hold to focus all my writing energy on [my thesis](http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/9147069).
Having finished that up and graduated last month, I can finally commit to providing some insight into how things have gone, for better and for worse.
Since it's been a bit longer than expected, there's a bit to get through.

It didn't take long to realise I had in my last post completely neglected one of the most useful functions of smartphones.
No longer carrying a smartphone meant I was no longer carrying a camera throughout day-to-day life.
This may seem obvious, but I didn't seem to consider this an issue the last time I had a dumbphone (2017-2018), but a quick look at my photo gallery shows that in the intervening years my photo taking has grown by an order of magnitude.

I'm by no means a photographer and I don't strive for artistic shots.
My photography is merely an attempt to capture enough of a moment to remember it by.
Mostly my photos are quick snaps of a hanging out with a group of friends, cuddling a cute cat I bumped into on the street or heading outdoors for a tea session (during which I particularly don't want the distraction of a smartphone).

I didn't want to give up these reminders of the past, so I quickly realised I'd have to add another device to my [arsenal](2023-09-01-opting-out-of-the-smartphone#devices).

Fortunately, my parents had an old digital camera lying around.
This was presumably a fairly high-tech camera in its day, but a lot has happened in the intervening 14 years.
Compared to a modern day smartphone camera, it hardly impresses, except perhaps for it's 10x optical zoom.
Nevertheless, it takes pictures, they usually come out looking okay, and I've always enjoyed the reliability and intent of a single purpose device.
It's just a bit more fun to dig a device out of a bag than to open an app.
It imbues the process with a sense of purpose, focusing your mind on the action you're about to perform.
In the long run, I think it's leading me to take more photos rather than less.

Over new year's, I went on a trip to Hamburg with some friends.
This was my first longer trip without a smartphone, and it worked out a bit so-so.
We were a large group, staying at different places and making last minute plans in one big group chat.
Not having easy access to it meant I was often unsure what was going on, and lacking map software made it hard for me to get involved with planning for places to go.

A friend of mine travelled through Europe last summer with only a dumbphone, and it was partially what inspired me to do the same for this trip.
Travelling solo, he could largely leave things up to chance.
If things didn't quite work out --- and on several occasions they didn't --- he was at least only inconveniencing himself.
However, travelling in a party of 9 with a cocktail of different requirements, we couldn't be so spontaneous.
We needed to find things to do that worked for everybody, and it required quite a lot of planning.
While others were frantically searching online maps, I felt out of the loop and unhelpful, frequently having to ask others (chiefly my partner) what was going on.

I'd like to give smartphoneless travel another go at some point, but then for smaller trips.
Trips of this size simply required far too much coordination for it to be feasible.

Getting public transport has sucked, and just keeps getting worse as everything becomes increasingly app-focused.
In addition to the things I mentioned last time ([bus cards discontinued in 2019](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/skane/jojo-korten-forsvinner), [timetables removed from bus stops in 2021](https://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/skanetrafiken/pressreleases/13-december-ny-tidtabell-paa-skaanetrafiken-3057811#:~:text=Nytt%20f%C3%B6r%20i%20%C3%A5r%20%C3%A4r,p%C3%A5%20v%C3%A5ra%20bussh%C3%A5llplatser)), at the start of the year they also [stopped taking card payments on regional buses](https://www.skanetrafiken.se/nyhetsarkiv/biljettforsaljning-pa-regionbussarna-upphor-vid-arsskiftet).
Supposedly they now have too many different ways to buy tickets, so why not get rid of the most universally accessible ones?

I did find out there are [travel cards](https://www.skanetrafiken.se/aktuellt/res-med-reskort), which allow you to buy tickets through their website in advance, and then activate the ticket by tapping the card to the terminal.
This sounded pretty good, but you can only ever have one kind of ticket loaded at a time, and buying a ticket through their website is a ~5 minute process.
They work well if you can plan ahead and know exactly how you're going to travel before you leave the house, but are way too cumbersome for any last minute plans or spontaneous changes.
Most of the time I've been travelling together with my partner, and it's just been easier for them to buy tickets for the both of us, for me to reimburse later, than to wait for me to faff around with the travel card.

Now, the main reason I decided to ditch my smartphone was to be rid of the constant distractions that come from being connected to the internet 24/7.
This, however, is a much more abstract topic than the above-mentioned concrete difficulties, and one I am much less equipped to discuss.
What I can do is bring up a few of the moments where I've been really grateful to be free from distractions.

Helping a friend move led to me having to find my way back home from an area I'd never been to in a nearby city.
This is something smartphones have optimised to a T.
You open a travel app, enter your destination, and follow the instructions; never having to interact with another being.
Lacking a smartphone instead required me to ask for directions to the nearest train station.
This lead to finding out another person who'd helped with the move was also heading to my hometown, and we decided to find our way together.
Having only exchanged a few pleasantries during the move, we now ended up talking for the entire hour-long journey.

Just this past weekend, on a train journey back from Copenhagen, I found myself in a long conversation with the father and son who ended up sharing my group of seats (they weren't shy to ask things like "What's your goal in life?" to a complete stranger).
When we reached my stop, I wished I could've stayed longer.

Living in Sweden, a conversation with a stranger is a rare occurrence.
Swedes are largely reserved, generally not averse to speaking to someone, but unlikely to spring into conversation have they not a very good reason for it.
I myself can be quite shy, though much less so than I was in younger years.
As our society is increasingly being dismantled and my feeling of disconnection with this country grows (perhaps something to expand on in a future blog post), these interactions with strangers give me some level of hope.
These chance encounters gain some special meaning to me, knowing they're unlikely ever to be repeated, and I am painfully aware how many of them I have missed over the years by closing myself off from my surrounding by focusing on my smartphone.
This has by itself been enough to justify the whole project.

Now, this experiment is going to enter a new stage.
At time of writing, I am just about to begin my first job after having graduated, and for work purposes, I will need to have a smartphone --- provided to me by my employer --- available during working hours.
My intention is to maintain a clean divide between work and personal, keeping the work phone entirely work-focused, with nothing beyond the necessities and nothing fun whatsoever, while I continue to use my dumbphone for personal use.
Exactly how this all works out remains to be seen, and I suspect it will once again be hard to resist the temptation to use the smartphone for more and more things.
Hopefully the clear distinction of it being a work device will make it easier to maintain.

I'll likely write another update about how this next phase works out, but this time I won't make any promises about when.
See you when I see you!
